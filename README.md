# 🧮 Calculator 

**Calculator** is a browser-based calculator app created as part of my journey through **The Odin Project** curriculum. This is my fifth project, focusing on **JavaScript functions, DOM manipulation, and event handling**. The project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
